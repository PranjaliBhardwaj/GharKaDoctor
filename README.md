## Problem Statement
Many healthcare organizations offer standard office hours for patient visits, typically between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
Routine check-ups and elective procedures were postponed during the pandemic, regular preventive care is crucial for identifying underlying conditions and maintaining well-being.
Patients in rural areas face challenges due to limited access to healthcare services.
The sheer number of patients seeking medical attention can overwhelm healthcare systems, leading to delays in appointments and reduced availability of doctor.
Waiting times to see specialists are increasing, and access to healthcare is becoming more difficult.
